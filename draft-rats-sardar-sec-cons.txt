1.  Introduction

   While [I-D.irtf-cfrg-cryptography-specification] provides excellent
   guidelines, remote attestation [RFC9334] has several distinguishing
   features which necessitate a separate document.  One specific example
   of such feature is architectural complexity.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  General Hierarchy of Authentication

   [Gen-Approach] proposes general hierarchy of one-way authentication,
   which can help precisely state the intended level of authentication
   (in decreasing order):

   *  One-way injective agreement

   *  One-way non-injective agreement

   *  Aliveness

   Recentness can be added to each of these levels of authentication.

4.  Threat Modeling

   This section describes "What can go wrong?"

4.1.  System Model

4.2.  Actors

4.2.1.  Legal perspective

   *  Data subject is an identifiable natural person (as defined in
      Article 4 (1) of GDPR [GDPR]).

   *  (Data) Controller (as defined in Article 4 (7) of GDPR [GDPR])
      manages and controls what happens with personal data of data
      subject.

   *  (Data) Processor (as defined in Article 4 (8) of GDPR [GDPR])
      performs data processing on behalf of the data controller.

4.2.2.  Technical perspective

   *  Infrastucture Provider is a role which refers to the Processor in
      GDPR.  An example of this role is a cloud service provider (CSP).

4.3.  Threat Model

4.4.  Typical Security Goals

5.  Attacks

   Security considerations in RATS specifications need to clarify how
   the following attacks are avoided or mitigated:

5.1.  Replay attacks

   See [Meeting-124-RATS-Slides].

5.2.  Relay attacks

   See [Meeting-124-RATS-Slides].

5.3.  Diversion attacks

   In this attack, a network adversary -- with Dolev-Yao capabilities
   [Dolev-Yao] and access (e.g., via Foreshadow [Foreshadow]) to
   attestation key of any machine in the world -- can redirect a
   connection intended for a specific Infrastructure Provider to the
   compromised machine, potentially resulting in exposure of
   confidential data [Meeting-122-TLS-Slides].

6.  Potential Mitigations

   This section will describe the countermeasures and their evaluation.
   See [Meeting-124-RATS-Slides].

7.  Examples of Specifications That Could Be Improved

7.1.  RFC9334

7.1.1.  Unprotected Evidence

   Section 7.4 of [RFC9334] has:

   |  A conveyance protocol that provides authentication and integrity
   |  protection can be used to convey Evidence that is otherwise
   |  unprotected (e.g., not signed).

   Using a conveyance protocol that provides authentication and
   integrity protection, such as TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], to convey Evidence
   that is otherwise unprotected (e.g., not signed) undermines all
   security of remote attestation.  Essentially, this breaks the chain
   up to the trust anchor (such as hardware manufacturer) for remote
   attestation.  Hence, remote attestation effectively provides no
   protection in this case and the security guarantees are limited to
   those of the conveyance protocol only.  In order to benefit from
   remote attestation, Evidence MUST be protected using dedicated keys
   chaining back to the trust anchor for remote attestation.

7.1.2.  Missing Roles and Conceptual Messages

   *  Identity Supplier and its corresponding conceptual message
      Identity are missing and need to be added to the architecture
      [Tech-Concepts].

   *  Attestation Challenge as conceptual message needs to be added to
      the architecture [Tech-Concepts].

7.2.  RFC9781

   As argued above for RFC9334, security considerations in [RFC9781] are
   essentially insufficient.

7.3.  RFC9711

7.3.1.  Inaccurate opinion

   Section 7.4 of [RFC9711] has:

   |  For attestation, the keys are associated with specific devices and
   |  are configured by device manufacturers.

   The quoted text is inaccurate and just an opinion of the editors.  It
   should preferably be removed from the RFC.  For example, in SGX, the
   keys are not configured by the manufacturer alone.  The platform
   owner can provide a random value called OWNER_EPOCH.

   For technical details and proposed text, see [Clarifications-EAT].

7.3.2.  Inaccurate Privacy Considerations

   Section 8.4 of [RFC9711] has:

   |  The nonce claim is based on a value usually derived remotely
   |  (outside of the entity).

   Attester-generated nonce does not provide any replay protection since
   the Attester can pre-generate an Evidence that might not reflect the
   actual system state, but a past one.

   See the attack trace for Attester-generated nonce at [Sec-Cons-RATS].

   For replay protection, nonce should _always_ be derived remotely (for
   example, by the Relying Party).

8.  Examples of Parts of Specifications That are Detrimental for
    Security

   The author believes that the following parts of designs are
   detrimental for the RATS ecosystem:

8.1.  Multi-Verifiers

   The design of multi-verifiers [I-D.deshpande-rats-multi-verifier] not
   only increases security risks in terms of increasing the Trusted
   Computing Base (TCB), but also increases the privacy risks, as
   potentially sensitive information is sent to multiple verifiers.

   Besides, the rationale presented by the authors -- appraisal policy
   being the intellectual property of the vendors -- breaks the open-
   source nature of RATS ecosystem.  This requires blindly trusting the
   vendors and increases the attack surface.

8.2.  Aggregator-based design

   Aggregator in [I-D.ietf-rats-coserv] is an explicit trust anchor and
   the addition of new trust anchor needs to have a strong
   justification.  Having a malicious Aggregator in the design trivially
   breaks all the guarantees.  It should be clarified how trust is
   established between Aggregator and Verifier in the context of
   Confidential Computing threat model.

9.  Security Considerations

   All of this document is about security considerations.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
