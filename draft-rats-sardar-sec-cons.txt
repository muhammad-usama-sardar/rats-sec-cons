   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Examples of Specifications That Could Be Improved

3.1.  RFC9334

3.1.1.  Unprotected Evidence

   Section 7.4 of [RFC9334] has:

   |  A conveyance protocol that provides authentication and integrity
   |  protection can be used to convey Evidence that is otherwise
   |  unprotected (e.g., not signed).

   Using a conveyance protocol that provides authentication and
   integrity protection, such as TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], to convey Evidence
   that is otherwise unprotected (e.g., not signed) undermines all
   security of remote attestation.  Essentially, this breaks the chain
   up to the trust anchor (such as hardware manufacturer) for remote
   attestation.  Hence, remote attestation effectively provides no
   protection in this case and the security guarantees are limited to
   those of the conveyance protocol only.  In order to benefit from
   remote attestation, Evidence MUST be protected using dedicated keys
   chaining back to the trust anchor for remote attestation.

3.1.2.  Missing Roles

   *  Identity Supplier and its corresponding conceptual message
      Identity are missing need to be added to the architecture
      [Meeting-122-TLS-Slides].

   *  Attestation Challenge as conceptual message needs to be added to
      the architecture.

4.  Security Considerations

   All of this document is about security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
