1.  Introduction

   While [I-D.irtf-cfrg-cryptography-specification] provides excellent
   guidelines, remote attestation [RFC9334] has several distinguishing
   features which necessitate a separate document.  One specific example
   of such feature is architectural complexity.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  General Hierarchy of Authentication

   [Gen-Approach] proposes general hierarchy of one-way authentication,
   which can help precisely state the intended level of authentication
   (in decreasing order):

   *  One-way injective agreement

   *  One-way non-injective agreement

   *  Aliveness

   Recentness can be added to each of these levels of authentication.

4.  Attacks

   Security considerations in RATS specifications need to clarify how
   the following attacks are avoided or mitigated:

   *  Diversion attacks [Meeting-122-TLS-Slides]

   *  Relay attacks

   *  Replay attacks

5.  Examples of Specifications That Could Be Improved

5.1.  RFC9334

5.1.1.  Unprotected Evidence

   Section 7.4 of [RFC9334] has:

   |  A conveyance protocol that provides authentication and integrity
   |  protection can be used to convey Evidence that is otherwise
   |  unprotected (e.g., not signed).

   Using a conveyance protocol that provides authentication and
   integrity protection, such as TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], to convey Evidence
   that is otherwise unprotected (e.g., not signed) undermines all
   security of remote attestation.  Essentially, this breaks the chain
   up to the trust anchor (such as hardware manufacturer) for remote
   attestation.  Hence, remote attestation effectively provides no
   protection in this case and the security guarantees are limited to
   those of the conveyance protocol only.  In order to benefit from
   remote attestation, Evidence MUST be protected using dedicated keys
   chaining back to the trust anchor for remote attestation.

5.1.2.  Missing Roles and Conceptual Messages

   *  Identity Supplier and its corresponding conceptual message
      Identity are missing and need to be added to the architecture
      [Tech-Concepts].

   *  Attestation Challenge as conceptual message needs to be added to
      the architecture [Tech-Concepts].

6.  Examples of Specifications That Are Detrimental for Security

   We believe that the following drafts are detrimental for the RATS
   ecosystem:

   *  Multi-Verifiers [I-D.deshpande-rats-multi-verifier]: the design of
      multi-verifiers not only increase security risks in terms of
      increasing the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), but also increases
      the privacy risks, as potentially sensitive information is sent to
      multiple verifiers.

   *  Aggregator-based design [I-D.ietf-rats-coserv]: Aggregator is an
      explicit trust anchor and the addition of new trust anchor needs
      to have a strong justification.

7.  Security Considerations

   All of this document is about security considerations.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
