Putting them in a separate draft may not give full overlap with all the right people.\n> \n> **Section 65** (Examples of Specifications that are detrimental for Security)\n> \n> I disagree strongly with this section. Both Multi Verifiers and CoServ endorsement distribution address real world issues. By suggesting that there should be no attempts to provide some standards that address these challenges you encourage custom and proprietary solutions that will inevitably miss some of the security considerations (or threat modelling per my previous suggestion). It is much more important that the problems are identified and appropriate security / privacy  considerations captured to avoid any proliferation of insecure implementations.",

The stated goals of the I-D are worth pursuing but they don\u2019t reflect the content of the draft, which in large part is simply turning comments about several I-Ds that have not garnered traction on the mailing list into an I-D. Almost all of the content that is pertinent to the stated goals is provided in references on Research Gate. The non-stated goals that consume most of the I-D appear to be stimulating work on RFC9334bis and halting work on coserv and multi-verifier.\n> \n> Ignoring the stated goals and instead focusing on just one of the perceived issues, in section 6, bullet 2, you are (still) asserting that an aggregator-design necessarily requires a new trust anchor and seem to imply that introduction of a new trust anchor is necessarily a problem. I challenged your assertion to no response in [1] and gave a key attestation-based example of how an aggregator may be useful in [2], also to no reply. I understand that it is your opinion that these use cases need not be addressed by a standards body, but others have different opinions. It may be that work like draft-jpfiset-lamps-attestationkey-eku-01 could be expanded to help address some of your concerns re: trust.\n> \n> Procedurally, I do not understand why you have marked this as updating RFC9334. Most of what would potentially influence an update to RFC9334 is incorporated here by reference and is not written as an update at all.\n> \n> One nit, the first sentence of section 6 should begin \u201cI believe\u201d since only one author is listed.\n> \n> [1] https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/rats/JkKLBiUwc7BSGnSciX4JT-GQKx4/\n> \n> [2] https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/rats/SSiqWGFg5tW0fjYLNgr7M8KaMu4/\n> \n>  ",

This would help ensure that everyone is speaking the same language during the discussion. RFC\u202f9334 already covers replay attacks in \u00a710; therefore we would suggest to give more focus on the part of potential vulnerability of exiting mitigation methods for the replay attack. \n> \n> Usama, could you please post a concise definition of the diversion attack on the mailing list?  The slides [2] describe the attack as requiring the theft of the private key stored in the root of trust, which seems to contradict the root\u2011of\u2011trust assumptions made in RFC\u202f9334.\n> \n> Regarding \u00a76, the multi\u2011verifier draft already contains (i) the use\u2011cases in \u00a73 of [1], (ii) the security considerations in \u00a77 of [1], and (iii) the privacy considerations in \u00a78 of [1]. We have analyzed threats and given corresponding mitigations.  We welcome any additional technical feedback so that the related discussion can be productive at IETF\u2011124.\n> \n> Please feel free to post your comments on the mailing list or open an issue on the draft\u2019s GitHub repository:\n>  https://github.com/ietf-rats/draft-deshpande-multi-verifier/issues\n\n- [ ] definition of the relay attack and diversion attacks",

How is Aggregator provisioned with the keys? Who owns those keys? How is that entity trusted?",
